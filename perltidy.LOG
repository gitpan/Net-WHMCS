Configuration and command line parameters for this run:

To find error messages search for 'WARNING' with your editor
Indentation will be with 4 spaces
Line 1 implies starting-indentation-level = 0
The nesting depths in the table below are at the start of the lines.
The indicated output line numbers are not always exact.
ci = levels of continuation indentation; bk = 1 if in BLOCK, 0 if not.

in:out indent c b  nesting   code + messages; (messages begin with >>>)
lines  levels i k            (code begins with one '.' per indent level)

First indentation disagreement seen at input line 7
Ending with indentation disagreement which started at input line 119
Note: Indentation disagreement detection is not accurate for outdenting and -lp.

1 long lines were outdented:
  First at output line 4
  use -noll to prevent outdenting, -l=n to increase line length

6 output lines exceeded 80 characters:
 First at line 4 by 8 characters
 Maximum at line 4 by 8 characters
 Last at line 147 by 3 characters
